# 508 Project - Teacher Database

This project models a database for an organization that trains public school teachers in various professional developments. Because this serves as a mobile application for the organization, the application has only been given the capabilities of reading. It can only read data because insertion and deletion of records through mobile would not be an efficient way to manage a database. 

The authors of the project include; Davis Tran, who built the front-end application, Modi Khamis, who built the database and updated the necessary documents, and Nathan West, who assisted in both the building of the front-end and back-end.
